## Intro

I have been playing this game for about two years, and I really LOVE this game! I feel I should do something and share my experience to the community and help others getting better at this game. I'm not a professional player and here I have are all based on my personal experience and opinion. Hopefully this blog can be helpful. ðŸ˜Š

## Basics

#### 1. Understanding the rules of the game

First thing to know is understand the game. For example, what is the win condition? what is elixir? how cards are deployed and target lock? There are also many game mode to play with, e.g. 1v1, 2v2, draft challenge, double elixir etc. Knowing the rules help you to construct a better deck against your opponent.

#### 2. Knowing all the cards

Card information is the next thing you need to know before being a good player. You don't need to remember all the properties of cards, but elixir cost, type, range are the least to know, others come with game experience.

#### 3. Knowing the counters.

Knowing the counters can give you advantage during the game, save your counter cards and elixir is also just as important. Also it's not necessarily you have the best counter card to your opponent card, but the card that prevents most of the damages from it. For example, `Inferno Tower` is a great counter to `Golem`, but if you don't have it and you have `Mini P.E.K.K.A` then that become your counter card.

## Advanced

#### 1. Remember your opponent deck

Remember your opponent deck is really basic to be good at this game, only after you can then predict what card your opponent will play, often this is the time to win a **'Well Played'** from your opponent. For example, you know the best counter card to your `Hog Rider` in your opponent deck is `Minion Horde`, then after few card rotations, you deploy `Hog Rider` and follow with a `Fireball`, your opponent will immediately regret his decision and this may just win you the game.

#### 2. Card placement and timing

Card placement and timing is where defines a good player and bad player. In a high level play, one bad placement can result in a lose. Unfortunately, this comes mostly from game experience. Next time you play, pay close attention to the range of the unit, it will lock on the closest target on sight.

#### 3. Understanding trade offs

The whole game is a elixir trade game. Who can get the best value of elixir wins the game. For example, you deployed your princess on the bridge, she one shot opponent tower and got killed by `Goblin Gang`, then you `Logged` `Goblin Gang`. During the whole play, you trade 5 elixir to 3 elixir with your opponent, so now you should ask your self, is the tower damage worth the trade? is two shots worth the trade?

Some other times you want to trade off your tower health with your opponent elixir. For example, your opponent played `Minions` and you let your tower take it. So you trade one fifth health of the tower health for 3 opponent elixir. How about if your opponent played `Bandit`? It really depends on the situation to evaluate those decisions.

#### 4. Two tower

I think this is the best part of the game. It opens up a lot of opportunities and game strategies. A tactical lane switch can sometimes get surprising result. Understanding two lanes and strategic play will help you become a good player.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy this reading and learned something it. One last thing to understand is there is no perfect deck, practice and watch replays is the best way to be good at this game.
